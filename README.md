My submission for the 2023 VCOE Hackathon by the Sea! This React-Native web-app has integrated functionality for stores to be able to add listings for products that they want to sell at a discounted price, as well as users that can sign in with a hard-coded database of login information. There is no embedded credit card gateway, this is more of a proof of concept. This project was created through Snack Expo.
